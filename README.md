## 📌 Project Introduction

This project is an e-commerce web application designed to provide a modern online shopping experience. The platform supports **three main roles**:

- **Buyer**: Can browse products, view details, and receive personalized product recommendations.  
- **Seller**: Can add and manage their products across seven categories: Books, Food & Drinks, Accessories, Clothing, Electronics, Household Items, and Skincare.
